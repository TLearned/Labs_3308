We met at 6pm on a zoom meeting, we then began filling out our project milestone 1 by 
finalizing our choice to make a encrypting software. We also established a trello where we can
see our current objectives that need to be completed and a discord which we will be using going
forward to replace the zoom meetings since they are easier to get messages through without having
to use an email.
